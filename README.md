# MachineLearning---TeamChooser
This project is a machine learning component draft for a greater project -- TeamChooser.
This project is eventually translated into JavaScript and lives on the server.

TeamChooser is an android application that creates teams for pick up games. The goal is to ensure game quailty by providing two fairly balanced teams according to each player's past performance.
